### Hi there, I'm Fabricio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with hands-on experience working with modern Javascript technologies like React and Redux, design/styling libraries like Material-UI, Styled Components, Ant Design and Bootstrap and another variety of third party libraries.

I'm also proficient on the back-end working with technologies like Node.js Express and GraphQL Apollo servers and creating API's using relational and non-relational databases like Postgres and MongoDB.

As a developer I am a problem solver who loves challenges, very attentive to details, adaptable,
independent, tenacious and currently looking for a company with an awesome environment and people who love what they do to bring, besides my technical skills, a lot of motivation and passion to keep learning
new technologies and building solutions based on efficiency, quality and performance without
forgetting to have fun doing it.
