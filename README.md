### Hi there, I'm Fabricio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with hands-on experience working with cutting-edge web technologies, including React, Redux, Typescript, NodeJS, and relational and non-relational databases. Since joining Blue Raster in Jan of 2021, I have been managing my time working on multiple projects creating and maintaining GIS mapping web applications utilizing Esri technologies with a focus on building solutions based on efficiency, quality, and performance.
